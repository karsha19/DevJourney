# C

This folder contains several folders and subfolders, each consisting of individual C programs. **Please note that even though the files have the `.cpp` extension, they are written in the C programming language**. This is because the programs were compiled using the TurboC++ software, which assigns the `.cpp` extension by default.

Each folder/subfolder contains individual C programs, organized based on the type or category of problem they solve. 

## Important Note

- **Proceed with caution**: These `.cpp` files are C programs and may not behave as expected when compiled with modern C++ compilers.

Make sure to replace `file.cpp` with the actual file name and use a C-specific compiler option, if needed.
